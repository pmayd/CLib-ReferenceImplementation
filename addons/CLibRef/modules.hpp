///////////////////////////// ENTRY POINTS /////////////////////////////
// Entry points are special functions that get called automatically at some point. This means that
// they serve as the entry to the code-execution of any mod. An entry point in standard SQF is the init.sqf
// CLib has its own entry points (which are more sophisticated than standard Arma'sb_type
// Entry points are determined based on the name of a given function. All entry points are called as soon as possible (that
// is after the CLib-framework and all dependencies of the respective module has been initialized). The following entry points exist:
// - FNC(clientInit) This function gets called on any client (not the server nor a HC) [condition: hasInterface]
// - FNC(serverInit) This function gets called on the server (not on any client ar any HC) [doncition: isServer]
// - FNC(hcInit) This function gets called on every headless client (HC) (not on any client nor the server) [condition: !isServer && !hasInterface]
// - FNC(init) This function gets called on every machine (including all clients, the server and all HCs) [no condition]
// Note that the global init-entry point gets called before the more specialized ones.
