/**
 * CLibRef - clientInit
 * 
 * Author: Raven
 * 
 * Description:
 * Initializes the CLibRef PFH module on the client-side. This example uses CLib's waitUntil
 * function to mimic a repeatable, clientside trigger
 * 
 * Parameter(s):
 * 0: None <Any>
 * 
 * Return Value:
 * None <Any>
